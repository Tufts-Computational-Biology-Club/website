We are a student-run club open to all students in the Tufts University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences.

Our goal is to create a supportive environment where students at all levels can:

- develop their computational biology skills
- share knowledge
- collaborate on exciting projects

Whether you're just starting out or already experienced, there's a place for you in our community!

Use this website to get to know us, access resources, and get involved with our club!
