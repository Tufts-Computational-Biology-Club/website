### What we do
- **Invited Speakers** — Guest speakers talk about techniques they’re developing and implementing in their own research, as well as the trajectory their careers have taken.
- **Skill-sharing workshops** — Cover aspects of coding from writing your first function to backing up and sharing Git repos.
- **Open-coding sessions** — Collaborative troubleshooting and skill-sharing for everyday coding challenges.
- **Vibe-coding** — Work together on personal coding projects once a month.
- **Journal club** — Informal discussions and critiques for selected publications.

Meetings are held weekly over Zoom on Thursdays from 2:30–3:30 PM, alternating between open-coding and other planned events.

### How open-coding works
- Bring your own problems!
- Share challenges and collaboratively find solutions.
- Skill building and knowledge sharing: Learn from peers, with experienced coders guiding beginners. Sign-up sheet available to teach a fundamental or specialized coding concept to peers.
- Flexibility: No strict agenda—work at your own pace and engage in spontaneous collaboration.

### Upcoming events
- TBA — Check back soon! We will post the schedule for the Fall 2025 semester.
- Want to propose a talk or workshop? Open an issue or PR with details.
